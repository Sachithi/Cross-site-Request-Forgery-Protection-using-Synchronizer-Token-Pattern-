Prevent Cross-site Request Forgery using Synchronizer Token Pattern
The usage of this sample application is discussed in my blogpost 

Instructions: Download the project folder,extract it and put inside wamp/www (If you are using WAMP Server). Most of the time wamp will be inside C:/ Drive. Then start the wamp server and open the browser and type localhost/<folder_name>.

eg: localhost/SynchronizerTokenPattern/CSRF-Protection
